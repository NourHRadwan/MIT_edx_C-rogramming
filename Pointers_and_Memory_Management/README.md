# Learning outcomes
#In this course, I will examine a key concept, foundational to any programming language: the usage of memory.

This course builds upon the basic concept of pointers, discussed in C Programming:
1. Modular Programming and Memory Management, and introduces the more advanced usage of pointers and pointer arithmetic. 
2. Arrays of pointers and multidimensional arrays are addressed, and I will learn how to allocate memory for my own data during program execution. This is called dynamic memory allocation at runtime using pointers. 

# At the end of this course, I  will be able to: 

1. Visualize the concept of a pointer and use it to pass variables to functions by reference in order to modify them via the function
2. Apply pointer arithmetic in order to address elements of both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays
3. Use arrays of strings to store lists of strings in one array variable
4. Control memory usage by dynamically allocating and freeing memory at runtime.
