# Learning outcomes
# In this course:
1. I  will learn to use logical statements and arrays in C. Logical statements are used for decision-making with follow-up instructions, based on conditions you define. 
2. Arrays are used to store, keep track of, and organize larger amounts of data. I will furthermore implement some fundamental algorithms to search and sort data.


# By the end of this course:
1. I will have gained experience with programming concepts that are foundational to any programming language and be one step closer to a career in computer engineering.

2. Use logical conditions to control the flow of a program via branch statements (if-else), repetition (for or while loop) and nesting of these structures
3. Create and modify arrays to store integer and floating point numbers and explain how arrays are organized in memory
4. Create null-terminated arrays of characters to store and modify strings (of characters)
5. Sort and search arrays of numbers and characters using bubble sort, selection sort, linear search and bisection
