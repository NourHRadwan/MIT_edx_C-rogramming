# The course is for me to write my first line of code.

# In this course I will learn to:

1. Define, distinguish and give examples of hardware/software, computer programs/algorithms
2. Explain the concept of a variable and declare, initialize and modify variables of data types int, double and char
3. Create and comment simple C-programs that may print text, special characters and variables to the screen with controlled formatting
4. Create simple C-programs that utilize for-loops to repeat blocks of instructions

# Letâ€™s get coding!
